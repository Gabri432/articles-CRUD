# articles-CRUD
Basic CRUD application written in go.

This repository is intended for learning porpuses only.
The idea is to make practice with the way Go makes REST APIs.

My intention was also not to use the "gorilla/mux" package in order to understand better some other mechanincs of API calls in Go.
