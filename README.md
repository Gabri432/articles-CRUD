# articles-CRUD
Basic CRUD application written in go.

## This repository is intended for learning porpuses only.
The idea is to make practice with the way Go makes REST APIs.

My intention was also not to use the "gorilla/mux" package in order to understand better some other mechanincs of API calls in Go.

I have used the "Invoke-RestMethod" command because I was using PowerShell.

## I have taken inspiration for this code from this YouTube video:
